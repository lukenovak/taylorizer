# About the Taylorizer

The Taylorizer is the definitive statement in the famous New Jersey debate about what to call [this meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pork_Roll). Those of us who are enlightened call it by it's correct name, "Taylor ham", and this extension seeks to eliminate any other incorrect references to it by another name.
